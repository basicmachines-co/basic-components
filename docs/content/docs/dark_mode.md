<Prose>

Setting up dark mode is a great feature, but can be overly complex and troublesome. You can use the [Mode Toggle](/components/mode_toggle) component
to switch between light/dark or system synced themes. 

All the components in Basic Components support light and dark theme's natively. 

See the  [ModeToggle](/components/mode_toggle) docs for more info.
